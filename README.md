# Plasma Cut Calibration with QTPlasmac

Classic test cut file(s) for dialing in (calibrating) your plasma cut speeds and heights.

The intial file is straight cust to allow focus on feed rate and cut height.  A subsequent test file focusing on how machine handles sharp corners will be added in due course.

Usage of the files is documented in a comments block at the head of the file. Please review this for file specific details.

## Note
To support the interception of cut height the M150 file needs to be placed in the config folder alongside the M190 file.
