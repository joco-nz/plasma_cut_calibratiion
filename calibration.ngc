(This file is for testing cutting feed rates using variables in the values below)
(You may need to adjust the pierce values to match your cutting machine and material thickness)
#100 = 1500 (Starting Feed rate)
#101 = 100 (Feed Rate Increase per test cut)
#102 = 0 (Y Starting position)
#103 = 6 (Y axis incremental move per cut)
#104 = 100 (X axis length of test cut)
#105 = 10 (Number of test lines to cut)
#106 = 12 (Outside cut offset)
#122 = #100 (feed rate increment total)
